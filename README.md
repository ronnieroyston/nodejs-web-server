# Nodejs Web Server Lite

This is a Web Server implemented using Node's native HTTP module.

### Release Notes

The server assumes a "/public" directory exists in the location of the Node script and that all HTML files include the `.html` file extension. This "/public directory is the root directory of the web server. Subdirectories under the root directory are each assumed to have an `.index.html` file.
